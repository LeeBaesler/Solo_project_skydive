Skydive_Logbook

1. The Skydive_Logbook gives skydivers a place to log their jumps and upload their content (photos and videos). Skydive_Logbook can be used in tandem with the physical logbook, but removes some of the stress skydivers feel about losing their logbooks. 
  
2.  Skydive_Logbook also uses OpenWeatherMap API to render real-time weather information the client can use if they are considering a few jumps that day. 

3.  Skydive_Logbook also uses frameworks that allow users to save and render photos and videos that can be viewed and played on different devices (images/videos don't need to be saved locally to be viewed).

Getting Started

  Skydive_Logbook is deployed through Heroku at URL: https://skydive-logbook-solo-project.herokuapp.com/#/info
